    <h1>Live On Wednesday</h1>
    <p>
      Sitting at the table, consuming a simple glass of wine, one friend looks
      across the table at another and asks "Want to start a band?" The recipient
      of the question ponders for a moment, and responds, "Yes." A third,
      non-musically inclined friend, asks "what's the name the band?" The
      immediate response: "We don't need a name until we have a gig!" The
      musically challenged friend turns to the owner of the wine bar and asks:
      "You want a band to play next Wednesday?" "Sure" is the response. "Now you
      need a name."

      Live On Wednesday was born. A small group of friends who perform when
      another friend asks them.
